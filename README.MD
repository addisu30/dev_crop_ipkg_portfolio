As of the progress of project update, we have made the following changes to the deliverables of our portfolio project:
User Interface Enhancements: After receiving feedback from users and conducting further usability testing
Reasoning: By improving the UI, I aim to create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience for potential employers or stakeholders who will be reviewing my portfolio. A polished and visually appealing UI can leave a positive impression and demonstrate my attention to detail and design skills.
Reporting Functionality (On Progress): During the development process, we realized the importance of comprehensive reporting â€˜features for inventory management. To provide more value to users and showcase my capabilities, we have decided to include additional reporting functionality in the app. This will enable users to generate detailed reports on inventory levels, sales, and other relevant metrics.
Reasoning: Including robust reporting functionality demonstrates our understanding of the practical needs of inventory management and highlights our ability to implement modern technologies into the projects.
